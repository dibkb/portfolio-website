# 🎬 Building an Agentic AI Movie Recommendation System

**Using Graph Databases, Semantic Search, and Community Signals**

Finding a movie that matches your mood or taste shouldn't feel like solving a puzzle. That’s why we built an **agentic AI movie recommendation system** — a smart assistant that understands natural language queries and surfaces meaningful recommendations using a combination of **graph reasoning**, **semantic similarity**, and **community discussions**.

Let’s break down how it works 👇

---

## 🧠 Natural Language Understanding with LLMs

When a user enters a search query, we use an **LLM (LLaMA 3.3)** to process the text. The model performs **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to extract important information like:

- 🎬 **Movie titles**
- 👨‍🎤 **Actors / Directors**
- 📅 **Years**
- 🎭 **Genres**
- 🌐 **Search modifiers** (e.g., "Search Reddit", "Letterboxd")

---

## 🕸️ Querying the Graph Database (Neo4j)

If the query includes structured entities like _genres_, _directors_, or _release years_, we map the extracted elements into a **prebuilt Cypher query** to search our **Neo4j movie graph**.

### 📊 What’s in the Graph?

- **49,369 nodes** including movies, people, genres, and years
- **132,772 relationships**, like:
  - `ACTED_IN`
  - `DIRECTED_BY`
  - `HAS_GENRE`
  - `RELEASED_IN`

> Example:  
> _"Show me action movies directed by Christopher Nolan"_  
> → Cypher query pulls all action genre movies with the `DIRECTED_BY` relation pointing to Nolan.

## 🧬 Semantic Search for Similar Movies

If the user asks for **movies similar to another movie**, e.g.  
_“Show me movies like *The Departed*”_ —  
we switch to **semantic search**.

### How It Works:

1. Extract the movie title (`The Departed`) using NER.
2. Fetch its **summary embedding** from **Quadrant DB** (vector database).
3. Perform **cosine similarity** search against other embedded movie summaries.
4. Return the top N most similar results.

> Embeddings are generated using `jina-embeddings-v3` and stored in **Quadrant**.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community-Driven Discovery (Reddit + Letterboxd)

Our agent can also leverage online movie communities:

### 🔍 Reddit Integration

If the query contains **"Search Reddit"**, the agent:

1. Uses **Brave Search** to find top `reddit.com` links.
2. Scrapes comment threads from those posts.
3. Uses the LLM to **extract movie mentions** from user comments.

### 📽️ Letterboxd Integration

For **"Search Letterboxd"**, the agent:

1. Finds top lists or reviews via Brave.
2. **Directly extracts movie names** from curated Letterboxd lists (no scraping comments).

## 🧰 Databases Used

### 1. **Neo4j Graph Database**

- Stores structured relationships between movies, people, genres, and time.
- Powers reasoning-style queries based on graph paths.

### 2. **Quadrant Vector Database**

- Stores dense embeddings of movie summaries.
- Enables similarity search using cosine distance.

## 🚀 Bringing It All Together

This hybrid system empowers users to explore the movie world using just natural language. Whether you're searching by genre, similarity, director, or online opinions — the AI understands your intent and routes the query through the best tool for the job.

This is **agentic AI** in action — combining structured reasoning, semantic intelligence, and real-time web knowledge to help you find your next favorite film 🎥🍿
