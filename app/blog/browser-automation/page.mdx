# 🧠 Browser Automation Agent — Small Steps, Big Promise

Ever wished you had an AI assistant that could browse the internet _for you_?

Meet our **Browser Automation Agent** — a proof-of-concept agent that mimics a human-like browsing experience. It's powered by LLMs and a headless browser, capable of navigating websites, logging in, extracting data, and even comparing prices... all hands-free.

> ⚠️ Not ready to conquer the **Voeger Challenge** just yet... but it's a promising start 😅

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

Here's a peek into the technologies powering this browser automation agent:

### 🧠 AI Models

- `LLaMA 3.3` — Responsible for parsing user prompts and generating structured step-by-step plans
- `LangChain` — Powers agent routing, planning, and memory around the LLM

### 🧰 Frameworks & SDKs

- `FastAPI` — Backend framework orchestrating prompt handling, execution, and response streaming
- `Playwright` — Headless browser automation for navigating, interacting, and scraping real web pages
- `Chromium` — Browser engine used under the hood by Playwright
- `WebSockets` — Enables real-time streaming of updates between the agent backend and frontend

### 💻 Code & UI

- `Vite` — Lightning-fast frontend bundler powering the minimal dashboard
- `Tailwind CSS` — Utility-first styling for rapid UI development
- `Zustand` — Lightweight global state management for real-time updates

## 🔧 Under the Hood

- All tasks were prompted using plain English.
- The agent uses a **headless browser** powered by automation scripts and enhanced with **LLM-driven decision making**.
- Navigation, clicking, form-filling, and scraping are all handled autonomously.

## 🧪 Under the Hood — Core Technicals

The agent is orchestrated using a **FastAPI** backend, which handles incoming natural language prompts and translates them into step-wise browsing plans using **LangChain**. These plans are then executed with **Playwright**, a powerful headless browser automation framework that enables the agent to **navigate, interact with, and extract data from real-world websites** just like a human would.

At the heart of the decision-making lies **LLaMA 3.3**, hosted on **Groq**, which provides ultra-fast reasoning to interpret user goals, generate structured actions (`NAVIGATE`, `INTERACT`, `EXTRACT`), and extract relevant information from raw page content. The browser interacts via actions like `fill`, `click`, or `fill-click`, based on contextual cues and objective-driven parsing. A streaming system continuously relays status updates back to the user, making the whole experience feel live and interactive.

From parsing flights to scraping stock reports, this agent shows what’s possible when **LLMs meet browsers**.
