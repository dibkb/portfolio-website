# 🧠 Building an AI-Powered Web Code Editor from a Screenshot or Prompt

**Using Multimodal LLMs, Monaco Editor, and Real-Time Code Generation**

Turning ideas into working web code has always felt a bit clunky to me — so I decided to build something fun: an **AI-powered web code editor** you can run right in the browser.

You can start with a blank canvas, upload a screenshot of a website you like, or just type a prompt. Then the AI takes over.

I used **LLaMA-4 Maverick** to convert screenshots into code, and **GPT-4o** to handle prompts and assist with edits. It’s all about making web development feel smooth, creative, and kinda magical — even if you're just experimenting on a weekend.
Turn screenshots into HTML/CSS/JS, help you edit live code with context-aware chat, and even preview your changes in real-time.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

Here's a peek into the technologies powering this AI-first editor:

### 🧠 AI Models

- `LLaMA-4 Maverick` — Multimodal model for screenshot-to-code
- `GPT-4o` — Prompt-based code generation and context-aware chat

### 🧰 Frameworks & SDKs

- `Next.js` — React-based frontend framework
- `Vercel AI SDK` — Real-time streaming of AI responses
- `Mastra AI` — AI orchestration and agent management
- `Netlify API` - Instant deployment of the website

### 💻 Code & UI

- `Monaco Editor` — The same editor behind VS Code
- `Iframe` — Live rendering of HTML/CSS/JS output
- `Console Interceptor` — Integrated debugging console

### ☁️ Storage

- `Amazon S3` — For image uploads and access

Let’s dive into how it works 👇

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. 🚀 Getting Started

You can begin your coding journey in one of three ways:

- **Start with an empty template**
- **Upload a screenshot of a website**
- **Upload an image and generate render code**

Once you provide an input, the editor spins into action — powered by LLaMA-4 Maverick (for screenshots) or GPT-4o (for prompts) — and generates clean, semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

### 2. 🧠 Screenshot-to-Code with LLaMA-4 Maverick

When a screenshot is uploaded, we use **LLaMA-4 Maverick**, a multimodal model capable of visually understanding and interpreting layout, components, and design cues. It produces:

- The full HTML structure
- Relevant styling (CSS)
- Any interactive behaviors (JavaScript)

This is especially useful when replicating existing website designs or UI inspiration from dribbble/Behance mockups.

---

### 3. 🧑‍💻 Code Editing with Monaco + Live Preview

The generated code is loaded into a **Monaco Editor** (the same code engine behind VS Code). This gives you:

- IntelliSense
- Syntax highlighting
- Autocompletion

As you modify the code, the output is rendered live in an **iframe-based preview window**, allowing for immediate visual feedback.

---

### 4. 🪵 Console Window: See Logs in Action

To make debugging seamless, we built a **console window** that captures:

- `console.log()` output
- Warnings
- Errors

Everything you’d see in a typical browser dev console, now integrated right into your workspace.

---

### 5. 🤖 Context-Aware AI Chat Assistant

Just like GitHub Copilot or Cursor, users can:

- Select a portion of the code
- Ask a question or give an instruction

The **AI assistant (GPT-4o)** understands the selected context and responds with accurate suggestions or code snippets. The output can be directly injected into the editor — no manual copy-pasting required.

And thanks to the **Vercel AI SDK**, the responses are **streamed in real-time**, making the experience feel incredibly responsive.

---

### 6. 🖼️ Upload and Use Images Easily

Users can upload custom images, which are stored securely on **Amazon S3**. From the **image window**, they can:

- Preview uploaded images
- Copy pre-generated HTML code to embed those images
- Paste directly into the HTML editor

Perfect for designing web pages that include assets like icons, logos, or product images.

---

### 7. 🌐 One-Click Deploy with Netlify

Once your website looks good in the preview, you can hit a **"Deploy"** button — and boom 💥 — it's live!

I hooked it up with the **Netlify API**, so with a single click, your project gets deployed and you instantly get a **shareable live link**. No need to fiddle with configs or hosting — it’s just part of the fun.

Perfect for showing off to friends, testing something real quick, or sharing a prototype with someone.

## ✨ Wrapping Up

This editor brings together the best of AI, developer UX, and modern web tooling — letting creators and devs go from **idea → screenshot → working website** in minutes.

No extensions, no heavy IDEs. Just pure AI magic in your browser.
