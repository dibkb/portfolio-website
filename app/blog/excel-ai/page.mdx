## 🕷️ Scraper Agent – Technical Details

The **Scraper Agent** is a custom-built Python tool that automates the process of extracting product data from Amazon using a combination of **Playwright** and **BeautifulSoup (bs4)**.

### 🔧 How It Works

Given a product **ASIN**, the scraper:

1. Launches a headless browser using **Playwright** to mimic real user interaction and load dynamic content.
2. Navigates to the corresponding Amazon product page.
3. Waits for all critical elements to load (title, images, price, reviews, etc.).
4. Parses the HTML using **BeautifulSoup** to extract:
   - Product Title
   - Price
   - Description
   - Bullet Points
   - Images
   - Reviews
   - Technical Details

The scraped data is then **saved to a database**, and only scraped **once per ASIN** to minimize load and prevent duplicate work.

> 📦 The scraper is also available as a standalone Python package on PyPI with over **7K downloads**.  
> 👉 [PyPI Package Link](https://pypi.org/project/dibkb-scraper/)\_

---

### ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

While the scraper performs well **locally** (with a ~70% success rate), it faces reliability issues in **production** when deployed on EC2:

- **Amazon blocks scraper traffic** from known server IPs, leading to failed loads or captchas.
- Rotating user-agents and adding delay helps, but isn't always sufficient.
- CAPTCHA-solving or proxy rotation hasn’t yet been fully integrated into the deployed version.

---

### 🗂️ Product Database View

A dedicated [`https://excel.borborah.xyz/products`](https://excel.borborah.xyz/products) route in the app dashboard lists all previously scraped ASINs. This view acts as both a:

- **Record of processed products**
- **Cache layer** to avoid re-scraping and reduce load

This route allows users to browse existing product data and avoids unnecessary scraping.

---

In the next section, we’ll dive into the **Product Enhancement Agent**, where LLMs begin turning raw data into actionable insights.

## 🧠 Product Enhancement & Web Review Agents – Technical Details

Our system uses multiple **LLM-powered agents** to analyze customer sentiment, extract key features, and recommend data-driven improvements to product listings. These agents operate sequentially and rely on real customer input as well as web content to guide optimization.

All LLM tasks are orchestrated using **LangChain** for modular and reusable pipelines.

---

### 🛠️ Product Enhancement Agent

This agent is powered by **LLaMA 4 (Maverick variant)** and performs a two-step pipeline:

#### Step 1: Sentiment Analysis & Feature Extraction

The agent takes **Amazon customer reviews** as input and uses the LLM to:

- Analyze the **sentiment** of the reviews (positive, negative, neutral)
- **Extract key features** mentioned by customers (e.g., build quality, delivery time, usability)

**Example Input Review:**

> “The product looks great but the battery life barely lasts a day. Also, the packaging felt very cheap.”

**Extracted Output:**

- **Sentiment:** Mixed/Negative
- **Features Mentioned:** Battery life, Packaging quality, Aesthetics

#### Step 2: Suggesting Improvements

Using the extracted features **and** product information (title, bullets, description), another **LLaMA 4 Maverick agent** suggests specific, actionable improvements.

**Example Output:**

- “Consider enhancing battery life or offering a clear disclaimer.”
- “Improve packaging aesthetics to match premium appearance.”

These suggestions are stored in the DB and reused in the **copy generation** and **SWOT analysis** stages.

---

### 🌐 Web Reviewer Agent

Some insights go beyond Amazon reviews. This is where the **Web Reviewer Agent** steps in:

#### Step 1: Title Rewriting for Search

Amazon titles are often long and messy. Before querying the web, we run the product title through an LLM that:

- Synthesizes a **shorter, cleaner title**
- Adds the keyword `"review"` to the end

**Example:**
Original: `XYZ Smartwatch with AMOLED Display and 7-Day Battery – Compatible with Android & iOS`  
Query String: `XYZ Smartwatch review`

#### Step 2: Web Search & Content Scraping

We then use the **SerpAPI** to search Google for relevant reviews:

- Top **2 organic result URLs** are scraped
- Content is extracted using a **headless browser + HTML parser**

#### Step 3: LLM-Based Summarization & Improvement Suggestions

The text content is passed to **LLaMA 4** which:

- Identifies key sentiments and trends across external reviews
- Suggests **pros, cons**, and additional **improvement opportunities**

This gives the seller a **broader market view**, especially when the Amazon review base is small or biased.

---

All data (reviews, insights, suggestions) is **stored once per product** and reused in downstream components like **SWOT analysis** and **AI copy generation**, ensuring both speed and cost efficiency.

## ✨ AI-Generated Copy & A/B Testing Agent – Technical Details

The **AI-Generated Copy Agent** creates enhanced product listing copy based on insights from the previous steps. The **A/B Testing Agent** then allows the seller to test multiple versions of the product listing in real-time, monitor user engagement, and make data-driven decisions on which copy performs best.

### 🧠 How It Works

#### Step 1: **AI-Generated Copy Creation**

- The agent uses **LLaMA 4** to generate an enhanced product description, bullet points, and title, using the gathered data (product features, sentiment analysis, suggested improvements, and competitor insights).
- It creates two versions of the copy:
  - **Current Version**: The original product listing as it currently appears on Amazon.
  - **AI-Enhanced Version**: A rewritten, optimized version based on the insights and suggestions from the previous steps.

**Example**:  
**Current Version**:

- "XYZ Smartwatch with AMOLED Display, 7-Day Battery Life, Compatible with Android & iOS, Available in Black and Silver"

**AI-Enhanced Version**:

- "XYZ Smartwatch – Sleek AMOLED Display, 7-Day Battery Life, Fast Charging, Compatible with Android & iOS. Available in Premium Black and Elegant Silver."

#### Step 2: **Present to User for Approval**

- The user is presented with both versions of the copy on the dashboard.
- The seller can review the AI-enhanced version and decide if it aligns with their branding and goals.

#### Step 3: **A/B Testing Deployment**

- If the user approves the AI-enhanced version, they can **deploy the A/B test** to a group of test users.
- A unique **link** is generated for each version of the copy:
  - **Version A (Current)**: The original listing copy
  - **Version B (AI-Enhanced)**: The optimized, AI-generated copy

#### Step 4: **User Engagement & Tracking**

- Users click on one of the links to view the product listing. The system tracks:
  - **Click-through rate (CTR)**
  - **Engagement time**
  - **Geolocation and IP Tracking**: See where users are located, and which version they clicked, through **IP geolocation** and **maps**.
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Sellers can see a **live feed** of which version is performing better, including user demographics and geographic information.

#### Step 5: **Feedback Loop & Final Adjustments**

- If the **AI-Enhanced Version** shows more clicks and engagement, the seller can update the listing directly on Amazon.
- If the **Current Version** performs better, the seller can either refine the AI-generated copy or stick with the original listing.
- All metrics are saved in the **dashboard**, where the seller can review the test results and make a data-driven decision on which version to keep.

---

### 📍 Geo-Location & IP Tracking

- The dashboard not only displays which version is performing better but also **maps user activity** based on their **location** and **IP address**.
- This allows the seller to:
  - Understand where the test users are from (country, state, city)
  - Identify potential markets for expansion
  - See which regions prefer which version of the copy

The real-time tracking helps optimize the product listing and marketing strategy on a **global scale**.

---

### 📊 Results & Updates

Once the A/B test is complete, the system **automatically calculates** which version has higher engagement, conversion rates, and overall success. The seller can then:

- **Update the product listing** on Amazon with the winning copy.
- Continuously monitor the performance of the new listing via the dashboard, ensuring the best possible version is always live.

This iterative process ensures that the seller’s product page is continuously **optimized for maximum conversion** and tailored to user preferences.

---

This concludes the technical breakdown of the **AI-Generated Copy** and **A/B Testing** process. The **AI Copy** agent and **A/B Testing** agent work together to optimize product listings using real-world data and user feedback.
